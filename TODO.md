- Refactor to smaller units
- Handle comments in malware file lists.
- Add in manual prompting mode.
- Start Changelog
- Get extra files out of the Apple list...
- and add to a new community curated list based on
	- Jamfnation thread on it
	- Code from Elliot Jordan
	- Allister Banks
	- Take a peek through AdwareMedic's stuff
	- Download and see what MacKeeper craps up
- Does this need a defaults system, or can it/should it be managed by FORCING people to have to edit the global files list at the beginning?
- Documentation
- Tests. Lol.
- Figure out how to modularize "tricky" files like vsearch LaunchD jobs.
	- Probably need to go to XML file lists AND
	- Have a LaunchD type that can regex search through */Library/[LaunchAgents|LaunchDaemons]/com.<something>.<something>.plist
- Which reminds me-probably makes sense to limit regex search on LaunchD jobs files to the ProgramArguments rather than the entire file.
- Ensure all docstrings/comments sub 73 length, punctuated.
- Audit variable names in refactored code to be consistent, helpful, and self-documenting.
	- Adware not Malware
- Add /Library/Application Support/SavingThrow/Quarantine folder
- Zip quarantined files
- Add better caching (don't download if not needed)
- Ensure always reports to log
- Add stdout (non ea) option
- Add XML ADF format.
